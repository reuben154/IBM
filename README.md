# Stream Analytics using IBM WATSON
Built a basic Streams application by using the Python API.
Deployed the application by using the Streams Console courtesy of IBM.
Connected the  application to an external data source(I used an online dataset,bundled as Stream Application Bundle).
Used the filter function to identify data of interest with the help of writing a lambda function.
Visualized applicationâ€™s output data with the help of Pyhton's Matplotlib library.
Coded in python with a little bit of json.
